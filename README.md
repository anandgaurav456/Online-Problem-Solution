### Problem:
In this world of peer to peer economy and reciprocal system of reviewing, there has been a lot of problem in honesty while giving a review. So, creating a model in order to tackle this problem.

### Objectives:
There are basically two important objectives, one is to maximize the satisfaction level and the other is to maximize the average rating.

### Introduction:
In rating systems like Ola, Uber etc, there is a reciprocal rating system. In this both give each other rating. How honest are these reviews and ratings? Giving an honest review in order to help others is not very common in market. Everyone reviews everyone else but leads to high level of reciprocity. As a result, we never see an Uber driver with a rating less than three.

In order to tackle this problem, a model is created which is simulated for a large population in order to see the results.  
Everything was done on PYTHON platform which is an efficient tool for handling large datas.

### Creating the Model:
A [Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RRUxvIGp56bt54waffPCV2RBhS9dpOGZ/view?usp=sharing) was developed which was simulated for a large virtual population.

### Results and Discussion:
The simulations were made to iterate for thousands of times and observations were made. Even after so many iterations, rating given was either 1 or 5. This was due to maximizing the utility which would give an increasing or decreasing plot for utility with rating. So, it is either found out to be 1 or 5.    
From the following [Plot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYsS-WieKQpkIGZl_4cqgl0oybHUCQPK/view?usp=sharing), observation was made that rating given was related to the Satisfaction rating in last interaction. Also, correlation between logarithmic rating and satisfaction was calculated. A correlation table was made using Python's Numpy corr.  
An observation was made that a value nearly 0.6 was obtained for both previous satisfaction vs rating and logarithmic previous satisfaction and logarithmic rating.  

### Conclusion:
In order to tackle the problem of trust in the online marketplace and honesty in reciprocal ratings/ reviews, a model was developed which returned a rating that can be given in order to benefit them. The model did not give very convincing results to tackle our problem.  

### Future Work:
An attempt was made to overcome the problem by creating a model but did not get very satisfactory results. Thus, changes and additional work can be done in future in order to overcome our problem.
